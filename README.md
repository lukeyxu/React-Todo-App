# React-Todo-App
This is a React todo app using Babel ES6, localStorage and Webpack. 
It needs to be run on a local server, and you could simply run npm install, and then `npm install -g webpack-dev-server`(if you do not have webpack-dev-server install globally before).  
Run `webpack-dev-server` in command line and the app should live and run.
